# Voron Plater Configs
Here you'll find exported plater STL's for various Voron printers. These generally follow the Print it Forward guidelines for functional parts to get a Voron printer working.

There are plates configured for 120mm, 250mm, 300mm and 350mm depending on the printer size you're using. Please keep in mind that all but the 120mm are sized down by about 10mm per config (250 is 240) as to not hit edges of the plate. If you're having leveling issues on your printer that you can't resolve, it can sometimes help to size down the plate based on on your build capacity. 

These plate STL's only include the GitHub file versions up to the last commit date.
