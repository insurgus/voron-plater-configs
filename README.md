# Voron Plater Configs


![Slicer Preview](https://i.imgur.com/UsvO0hB.png)


Here you'll find exported plater STL's for various Voron printers. These generally follow the Print it Forward guidelines for functional parts to get a Voron printer working.

There are plates configured for 250mm, 300mm and 350mm depending on the printer size you're using. Please keep in mind that all plates are sized down by about 10mm per config (250 is 240) as to help mitigate cool edges of the build plate. If you're having leveling issues on your printer that you can't resolve, it can sometimes help to size down the plate based on on your build capacity. 

These plate STL's only include the GitHub file versions up to the last commit date. Note there are no controller or hot end options in these sliced plates. You will have to print those based on your individual use case.
